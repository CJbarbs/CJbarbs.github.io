## Aim
I wanted to create a static website, my intention wasn't to be too ambitious on the design and making something which is simple and clean looking. I am not tryig to go for a designing job, so I think the simple layout plays best to someone who just wants to see what the developer is capable of and get in contact.

### Home Page 
This is the first page visitors to my site will be seeing so I wanted a smooth transition when the website loads so I used a fade in animation for all the text and navigation bar. The user will be greeted with a photo of Perth (my home town) and my name and title. I added in a smooth scroll animation effect to the anchor link.

### About 
Small paragraph about me, along with a list of what I know, my social media links and projects I have made myself.

## Challenges 
Choosing a design was the biggest challenge, I really wanted to make something that was just black and white but struggled to make it not look too plain or boring. 
I learnt a lot about the design phase with what works and what doesn't work. Looking at other websites really helps for inspiration.

### Building 
I used CSS and JS plugins for the site to improve the interface and design. 

### Images 
Image compress was used on the landing page to improve loading times.

### Responsiveness
The website was made with mobiles in mind and displays correctly on most modern smartphones.
