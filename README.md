## Aim
I wanted to create a static website, my intention wasn't to be to ambitious on the design and making something which is simple and clean looking.
I wanted smooth navigation and links to my social media accounts.

### Home Page 
This is the first page visitors to my site will be seeing so I wanted a smooth transition when the website loads so I used a fade in animation for all the text and navigation bar. The user will be greeted with a photo of Perth (my home town) and my name and title. I added in a smooth scroll animation effect to the anchor links improve the user experience when moving to a section of the website.

### About 
Small blurb about me, will change the photo to something more professional later.

### Portfolio
Blank for the moment, but I wanted to show that I am working on things and will update soon.

### Contact 
This was a challenge, I was unsure of how to properly implement and if I should have my email on the site or use a contact form.

## Challenges 
Choosing a design was the biggest challenge, I really wanted to make something that was just black and white but struggled to make it not look too plain or boring. 
I learnt a lot about the design phase with what works and what doesn't work. Looking at other websites really helps for inspiration.

### Building 
I used some CSS and JS plugins for the site to improve the interface and design. Improvements can be made with making the code cleaner and more refined which I will work on in the future.

### Images 
The I only used a few images and the video on the portfolio section, all are royalty free images/videos. 

### Responsiveness
I did a lot of work with the responsive design of the site but the social media buttons need repositioning for mobile devices as they currently do not display correctly on small screens.
90% of the site shows correctly on mobile devices. 

### Improvements to be made
The website is over 10MB, I would like to reduce the size to <5MB using image and video compresion.
